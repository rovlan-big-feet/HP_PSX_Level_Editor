- Rom downloaded from https://wowroms.com/en/isos/playstation/download-harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone/31783.html (US version)
- The .bin can be converted into a mountable .iso (or mounted directly ? dunno)
- The arborescence of the mounted directory is given below :
.
├── movies
│   └── ea.str
├── potter.dat
├── potter.dir
├── slus_014.15
├── system.cnf
├── us.gam
└── zdummy.dat

- Obviously, the movies folder is for cutscenes, the .dat contains the models and other 3D stuff and the rest is either a config file or contains compiled code

- Got some results when scanning the .bin with psxprev (https://github.com/rickomax/psxprev), the tool manages to detect a bunch of files but fails to correctly display any of them. The offsets for the detected files are in psxprev_log.log.
